# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting plant leaf diseases using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
By analyzing leaf images, the model classifies whether a plant is healthy or affected by a specific disease.  
The goal is to assist in **early disease detection** and support modern agricultural practices.

## 🎯 Objective
- To build an automated image classification system for plant disease detection  
- To train a CNN model that can learn visual patterns from leaf images  
- To perform inference on unseen images with confidence scores

- ReLU activation for non-linearity  
- MaxPooling2D for downsampling  
- Flatten layer to convert features into vectors  
- Dense layers for classification  
- Softmax output layer for multi-class prediction

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Load dataset from directory  
2. Resize and normalize images  
3. Optimize data pipeline (cache, shuffle, prefetch)  
4. Build CNN architecture  
5. Compile the model  
6. Train the model  
7. Evaluate accuracy and loss  
8. Perform inference on new images

## 🔍 Inference Example
The trained model can predict disease from a new leaf image by:
- Loading the image  
- Applying the same preprocessing as training  
- Predicting class probabilities  
- Selecting the class with highest confidence  

Output:
- Predicted disease name  
- Confidence percentage
