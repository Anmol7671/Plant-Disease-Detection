🌱 Plant Disease Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
1. Abstract
Plant diseases significantly affect agricultural productivity and crop quality. Early detection of plant diseases can help farmers take preventive measures and reduce crop loss.
This project presents a Plant Disease Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify plant leaf images into healthy and diseased categories. The model is trained on a labeled image dataset and achieves approximately 84% accuracy. The system also supports inference on new unseen images, making it practical for real-world use.

2. Introduction
Agriculture plays a crucial role in the global economy. Plant diseases often remain unnoticed until they spread widely, leading to major losses. Traditional disease detection methods require expert knowledge and manual inspection, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
With advancements in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, CNNs have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks. This project uses CNNs to automatically detect plant diseases from leaf images, providing a fast and accurate solution.

3. Problem Statement
Manual identification of plant diseases is:
Time-consuming
Requires expert knowledge
Not scalable for large farms
Objective:
To build an automated system that detects plant diseases from leaf images using a CNN-based image classification model.

4. Dataset Description
The project uses the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
Dataset Characteristics:
RGB leaf images
Multiple plant and disease categories
Folder-based structure (each folder = one class)
Example Classes:
Tomato – Healthy
Tomato – Early Blight
Potato – Late Blight
Pepper – Bacterial Spot
The dataset is split into:
Training set
Validation set

5. Methodology
The project follows these steps:
Dataset loading from directory
Image resizing and normalization
Performance optimization using caching and prefetching
CNN model construction
Model training and validation
Model evaluation
Inference on new images

6. Data Preprocessing
Image Resizing
All images are resized to a fixed size (e.g., 224 × 224) to maintain consistent input shape for the CNN.
Normalization
Pixel values are scaled from 0–255 to 0–1 using normalization.
This improves training stability and faster convergence.
Performance Optimization
cache() – avoids repeated disk reads
shuffle() – prevents learning order bias
prefetch() – improves training speed

7. CNN Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of the following layers:
Conv2D Layer
Extracts features like edges and textures
Uses multiple filters
ReLU Activation
Introduces non-linearity
MaxPooling2D
Reduces spatial dimensions
Prevents overfitting
Flatten Layer
Converts feature maps into a 1D vector
Dense Layers
Fully connected layers for classification
Output Layer (Softmax)
Produces probability scores for each class

8. Model Training
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
Metrics: Accuracy
Epochs: Multiple epochs until convergence
The model learns patterns such as:
Leaf color changes
Texture variations
Disease spots and edges

9. Results and Performance
Model Performance:
Training Accuracy: ~84%
Validation Accuracy: ~82% (approx.)
The model shows good generalization on unseen validation data.
Accuracy and loss graphs indicate stable learning without overfitting.

10. Model Inference
After training, the model is used to predict disease from a new leaf image.
Inference Steps:
Load trained model
Load and resize image
Normalize pixel values
Predict class probabilities
